#### DCC Scoring Code

Scorer takes in subset of data rows (excluding events that do not need to be scored) and the column name shared by the measure.
It expects the values / scale of the data to already reflect what is in the original measure (i.e. shifting, possibly necessitated by the survey tool, has already occurred).
